# Neovim Setup and Configuration

This repo is used to automatically install neovim from source, update `init.vim` and `.vimrc`, and install plugins using `vim-plug`. Simply clone to the home directory (`~`) and run `install.sh` WITHOUT sudo. The script will then ask for super user permissions when it is installing dependencies.
