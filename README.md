# Neovim Setup and Configuration

This repo is used to automatically install neovim from source, update `init.vim` and `.vimrc`, and install plugins using `vim-plug`. Simply clone to the home directory (`~`) and run `install.sh` WITHOUT sudo. The script will then ask for super user permissions when it is installing dependencies.

For WSL, install all Source Code Pro patch fonts from [Powerline-Fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/SourceCodePro) and also install [wsltty](https://github.com/mintty/wsltty).
